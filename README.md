Lane Detection using Computer Vision for Self-Driving Cars


Lane detection is a critical component of self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles. Once lane positions are obtained, the vehicle will know where to go and avoid the risk of running into other lanes or getting off the road. This can prevent the driver/car system from drifting off the driving lane. There are multiple ways we can perform lane detection. We can use the learning-based approaches, such as training a deep learning model, However, there are simpler methods to perform lane detection as well. In this project, we are detecting lanes using Computer Vision with the popular OpenCV library in python.
